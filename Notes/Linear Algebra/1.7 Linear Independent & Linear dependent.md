## Abstract
When calaulating form a matrix to its reduced echelon form, We often meet one specific circumstance that we got a row that is completely zero. Thus for this generating set, this vector can be removed without affecting the span.

If a generating set exist such vector, we call that linear dependent. Linear Independent, otherwise.

## Decision
Basically, we can call a Linear dependent is that for vectors v1, v2, ... , vk, there exist scalar c1, c2, ... , ck, which there should be at least one scalar != 0, that makes 
$$v_1*c_1 + v_2*c_2 + ... + v_k*c_k = 0$$
Meanwhile, Linear dependent is the contrary.

## Calculation
There's one simple way to identify whether if a matrix is linear dependent or the contrary.
That is, solve the augmented matrix $\begin{bmatrix}Ax & V\end{bmatrix}$, where V = 0, aka, homogeneous.
If we are be able to get a answer other than all 0 in scalars, that's linear independent.
Contrarily, if we can only find all 0 scalars, that's linear dependent.

### Terminology
- Homogeneous : $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$
- non-homogeneous : $A\vec{x} \neq \vec{0}$
